Serializes AS3 objects into XML and back to value objects

h1. Why would I use it?

Strong typed objects instead of XML files (configuration, settings, markup, etc)
Serialise value object into XML and when you need it Desereliaze it back to a value object

h1. How does it work?

var xml:XML = Serializer.serialize( myDataTransferObject );
var myObject:MyDataTransferObject = Serializer.deserialize( xml );

h1. Which objects does it take?

Data Transfers Objects. Anything that be converted into text including Vectors, Array, XML, etc

h1. Which class members it can serialize / deserialize

public getters with setters and public variables

h1. How do I configure my classes?

You don't have to do anything. You only need to describe members you don't want to include

eg: 
[Transient] public var isLocalData:Boolean
